#This program reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).
#XXXXXX7890
#Extra:
#Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length (yes that is a vague requirement, comment your assumptions)


accountno = "1234567890"
print(accountno[:4])
print (accountno [6:])
