#There is a bit in this, break it down into smaller parts, 
#for example read in an integer first, 
#(and print it back out again, then do some arithmetic to it and print, 
#then read in a second one and add the two, and only then look at the formatting of the answer. 
#of course there are many ways of doing this.
